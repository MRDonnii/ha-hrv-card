## Overview

**HRV Card** is a modern, animated Lovelace card for **Home Assistant** that visualizes and controls Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) and Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV) systems.

The card provides a clear overview of airflow, temperatures, heat recovery efficiency, humidity, bypass state, fan speed, operation mode, alarms, filter status, CO₂ levels and optional fan RPM values in a single compact interface.

Unlike vendor-specific cards, **HRV Card is completely vendor-neutral**. If your Home Assistant integration exposes the required entities, the card will work regardless of manufacturer.

The built-in defaults for Dantherm writable controls are based on the excellent Home Assistant integration from **Tvalley71/dantherm**.

# Heat Recovery Calculation

The card expects a percentage sensor for **heat recovery efficiency**.

A commonly used formula is

```text
((Supply - Outdoor) / (Extract - Outdoor)) × 100
```

The recommended Home Assistant template clamps the result between **0%** and **100%**, supports both heating and cooling recovery and automatically returns `None` whenever the calculation cannot be performed.

A complete template sensor example is shown below.## Heat Recovery Efficiency Template Sensor

The following template sensor calculates heat recovery efficiency from the four temperature sensors.

It automatically:

- Returns **0%** when the bypass damper is open.
- Clamps the result between **0%** and **100%**.
- Supports both heating and summer cooling recovery.
- Returns `None` when the calculation cannot be performed.

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: Dantherm Heat Recovery Efficiency
        unique_id: dantherm_heat_recovery_efficiency
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        state: >
          {% set bypass = states('cover.dantherm_bypass_spjaeld') | lower %}
          {% set outdoor = states('sensor.dantherm_udeluftstemperatur') | float(none) %}
          {% set supply = states('sensor.dantherm_indblaesningstemperatur') | float(none) %}
          {% set extract = states('sensor.dantherm_udsugningstemperatur') | float(none) %}

          {% if bypass in ['open', 'opening', 'on', 'true', '1', 'yes', 'ja', 'åben', 'aaben'] %}
            0
          {% elif outdoor is not none and supply is not none and extract is not none and (extract - outdoor) | abs > 0.1 %}
            {% set efficiency = (((supply - outdoor) / (extract - outdoor)) * 100) %}
            {{ [0, [efficiency, 100] | min] | max | round(1) }}
          {% else %}
            {{ none }}
          {% endif %}
```

| `supply_temperature` | Supply |
| `extract_temperature` | Extract |
| `exhaust_temperature` | Exhaust |

Example:

```yaml
labels:
  outdoor_temperature: Outside
  supply_temperature: Supply Air
  extract_temperature: Extract Air
  exhaust_temperature: Exhaust
```

---

# Temperature Thresholds

The airflow colors are fully configurable.

The card interpolates smoothly between each configured temperature.

Default values:

|---------|------------:|
| White | -10°C |
| Blue | 5°C |
| Green | 16°C |
| Yellow | 22°C |

  green: 16
  yellow: 22
  orange: 27
  red: 32
```

---

Example:

```yaml
appearance:
  animation: true
  show_labels: true
  show_badges: true
  show_temperatures: true

# Vendor Notes

## Dantherm

Supports writable **mode** and **fan level** entities.

## Genvex

Supports reversed heat recovery values using:

```yaml
appearance:
  invert_heat_recovery: true
```

## Nilan

Supports reversed heat recovery values using:

```yaml
appearance:
  invert_heat_recovery: true
```

## Other Systems

Any HRV or ERV integration can be used as long as it exposes compatible Home Assistant entities.

The card does not rely on vendor-specific APIs.

---

# Design Principles

HRV Card is built around a few simple principles.

- Vendor-neutral
- Minimal configuration
- Automatic handling of missing entities
- Smooth animations
- Responsive layout
- Native Home Assistant styling
- No external runtime dependencies
- Fully self-contained JavaScript bundle

Every optional feature disappears automatically when its corresponding entity is not configured, allowing the card to scale from a simple four-temperature display to a complete ventilation control dashboard.---

# Roadmap

The following features are planned for future releases.

## Planned

- 🎨 Additional theme customization using CSS variables
- 🌍 More language translations
- 📱 Improved mobile layout
- ✨ Additional animation options
- 🧩 More configurable status badges
- 📊 Optional airflow and energy indicators
- 🔌 Expanded compatibility with additional ventilation systems

Suggestions are always welcome through GitHub Issues.

# Browser Compatibility

HRV Card is written using modern JavaScript and is intended for current versions of Home Assistant.

It is regularly tested with:

- Home Assistant Dashboard (Lovelace)
- Chromium-based browsers
- Firefox
- Safari
- Home Assistant Companion App (Android & iOS)

---

# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome.

Whether you've found a bug, have an idea for a new feature, or want to improve the card, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that:

- The card builds successfully using `npm run build`
- Existing functionality is preserved

- Code style follows the existing project

---

# Reporting Issues

When reporting a bug, please include as much information as possible.

Helpful information includes:

- Home Assistant version
- Browser or Companion App
- Card version
- Your card configuration
- Screenshots or screen recordings
- Browser console errors (if any)

The more information you provide, the easier it is to reproduce and fix the issue.

---

# Translations

HRV Card automatically follows the language configured in Home Assistant.

Currently supported languages:

- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇩🇰 Danish

Community translations are very welcome.

---

# Compatibility

The card is designed to be vendor-neutral.

If your ventilation integration exposes Home Assistant entities for temperatures, fan level, operating mode, humidity, bypass, alarms or similar values, the card will most likely work without modification.

If you successfully use HRV Card with another HRV or ERV system, please consider opening a pull request so it can be added to the compatibility list.

---

# Credits

HRV Card was inspired by earlier Home Assistant ventilation cards such as **lovelace-comfoair**, but has been designed from scratch with a focus on:

- Vendor-neutral compatibility
- Modern Home Assistant design
- Smooth animations
- Flexible configuration
- Native Home Assistant interaction

Special thanks to the Home Assistant community and to the maintainers of the various HRV integrations that make this card possible.
